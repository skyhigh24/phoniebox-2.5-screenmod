!!THIS IS A DIRTY SOLUTION, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!! 

Just an Upload for the Files i edited to get the Phoniebox mini Player like i wanted it to be.
It is only a Response to a Question here: https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/discussions/2115#discussioncomment-12214106


i used Phoniebox v2.5 and since i dont use Internet on the Box (MAC Blocked in Router), that MOD never Broke anything.

Pleas Mind: 
I DID NEVER UPDATE TO A NEWER VERSION!!
if you use these Files i can not guarantee that nothing breaks and if it does, im not liable for it.
